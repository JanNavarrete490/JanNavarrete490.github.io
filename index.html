<h3>What do you expect to learn from this course (Information Technology Concepts)?</h3>
  
  <p>Well, I am expecting to learn a lot about Website Programming such as how to build adaptive websites sizes for multiple devices. 
  I would like to learn both Back end and front-End Programming when it comes to websites <p>

<h3>What do you want to learn to help you in your chosen Major?</h3> 
   
   <p>In my Current major Which is Software and Systems it would be best if we focused more on the back end of the website to focus more on
   how to properly code a website from scratch and teach us new ways that improve our ability to code the Websites <p>

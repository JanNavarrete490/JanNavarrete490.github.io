<p>What do you expect to learn from this course (Information Technology Concepts)? 

Well, I am expecting to learn a lot about Website Programming such as how to build adaptive websites sizes for multiple devices. I would like to learn both Back end and front-End Programming when it comes to websites <p>
<p>What do you want to learn to help you in your chosen Major? 

In my Current major Which is Software and Systems it would be best if we focused more on the back end of the website to focus more on how to properly code a website from scratch and teach us new ways that improve our ability to code the Websites <p>
